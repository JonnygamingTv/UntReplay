# UntReplay
Replaymod for Unturned!

Might use https://github.com/EvolutionPlugins/Dummy for spawning players, will see how difficult it is.

## Background
[Replaymod](https://www.replaymod.com/) is a classic Minecraft plugin that saves the state of your Minecraft world and can render it afterwards and pretty much allow you to move the camera in a controlled manner, and freeze the scene and other types of handling, making freecam recording much easier. UntReplay is a module/plugin that does the same, except it is for Unturned.

## Todo:
- Add rest of event listeners (optional method would be to just loop everything every 0.1s and save everything that is different)
- Add a method of reading the file and generating the actions based on it.
